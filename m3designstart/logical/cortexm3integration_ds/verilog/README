These files provide visibility of the verilog view of the integration level
which was used in generating the cycle model and the obfiscated RTL view.
They are not used by either the FPGA build flow or any simulations.

CORTEXM3INTEGRATIONDS - This is provided by the Cycle model, or obfuscated RTL.
                        There are wrapper versions in the cortexm3_model/verilog,
                        and cortexm3integration_ds_obs/verilog directories.
cm3_code_mux          - This is provided here for reference. The IoT subsystem
                        contains an identical version.
cm3_rom_table         - This is provided by the Cycle model, or obfuscated RTL.
cm3_flash_mux         - This is provided for reference, and not used in the
                        design.
