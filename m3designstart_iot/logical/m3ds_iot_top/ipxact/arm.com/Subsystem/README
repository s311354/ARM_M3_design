Introduction
------------

This release contains the m3ds_iot_top IP-XACT IEEE1685-2009 description. It includes the
following descriptions:

  * Bus interfaces for:
    - clocks
    - resets
    - static configuration pins (tie-offs)
    - AHB, AXI and APB interfaces
    - Trace port outputs
    - CoreSight Authentication, Timestamp, Events
    - Interrupts
    - SRAM
    - JTAG and SW Debug access

  * A component definition comprising:
    - Bus interfaces for most ports (see note 1)
    - A full list of ports
    - RTL configuration parameters

Notes
-----

1) There are a number of ports which do not have bus definitions assigned in the
   component definition, resulting in ad-hoc usage.
   Below is a list of those ports.
